            <b>The plot of the movie is about Intergalactic Travel.</b>
            Its about how a man gets to fulfill his dreams.
            And care about his family at the same time.

            However the central theme of the movie is about love.
            About how one loves ones' profession and thirst for exploration even in the face of non-existant economic incentives.
            About how one loves ones' family, friends and the entire community of humans on the planet.
